# Team Nocturnal â€” Universal Post-Install Script

A simple **post-install helper** for Linux that works across **Fedora/RHEL**, **Debian/Ubuntu**, **Arch**, and **openSUSE**.  
It offers ready-made presets for **Gaming**, **Media**, **General use**, **Lite**, and **Full** setups.

The **Gaming** preset automatically chains to the Team-Nocturnal Gaming Setup script:
[universal_gaming_setup.sh](../gaming/universal_gaming_setup.sh)
