Fedora-Tools

A collection of Linux automation scripts by Team Nocturnal developer @XsMagical

About

I’m a Team Nocturnal developer who started in the Android AOSP scene back in 2010, building and maintaining custom ROMs and tools for the Android modding community. 
Over the years, I’ve shifted focus from Android to Linux, carrying the same goal forward: to make advanced customization and optimization easier for everyone.
Fedora-Tools is my collection of scripts for Fedora Linux that automate tedious tasks, speed up system maintenance, and add features that power users expect. 
These scripts are tested on Fedora 42 and designed to work out of the box without manual command-line typing.
